## 🎯 What is KinetixLab?

KinetixLab is a web-based biomechanics analysis tool designed specifically for Singapore's Physical Education curriculum. It combines computer vision and AI to analyze student movement videos, providing detailed feedback aligned with MOE PE Syllabus standards.

### Key Features

**📹 Video Analysis**
- Upload exercise videos (squats, throws, kicks, jumps)
- Scrub through video frame-by-frame
- Fullscreen mode for detailed viewing

**🦴 Real-Time Pose Detection**
- Live skeleton tracking using MediaPipe
- Automatic joint angle measurements
- Visual overlay on video

**🤖 AI-Powered Feedback**
- Movement identification and classification
- Step-by-step technique breakdown
- Comparison against FMS standards
- Safety ratings and corrections

**📸 Multi-Frame Snapshots**
- Capture multiple frames across the movement
- View joint angles at different phases
- Download annotated images for reports

**📊 Detailed Analysis**
- Joint angle measurements (elbows, knees, shoulders)
- Movement phase detection (preparation, execution, follow-through)
- Correctness assessment for each step
- Actionable improvement suggestions

**📚 Analysis History**
- Save and review past analyses
- Track student progress over time
- Quick access to previous assessments

## 🏃 Supported Movements

KinetixLab can analyze various Fundamental Movement Skills:

- **Squats** - Depth, knee alignment, back position
- **Overhand Throws** - Arm position, rotation, follow-through
- **Underhand Throws** - Swing path, release point
- **Kicks** - Leg extension, hip flexion, balance
- **Jumps** - Takeoff, landing mechanics
- **Catching** - Hand position, body alignment

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Upload Video** - Record or upload a video of the movement
2. **Specify Movement** (Optional) - Tell the AI what skill to analyze
3. **Capture Frames** - Choose single frame or multiple snapshots
4. **Get Analysis** - Receive instant AI feedback with:
   - Movement identification
   - Joint angle measurements
   - Step-by-step assessment
   - Safety rating
   - Improvement suggestions
5. **Review & Download** - View detailed results and download annotated images

## 📝 Example Analysis Output

When you analyze a squat, you'll receive:

- **Movement Identification**: "Squat" (95% confidence)
- **Phase Detected**: "Bottom Position"
- **Joint Angles**:
  - Right Knee: 87° (Ideal: 90-100°) - Needs Improvement
  - Left Knee: 92° (Ideal: 90-100°) - Good
  - Hip Angle: 85° - Good depth
- **Step-by-Step Assessment**:
  - ✅ Stance: Feet shoulder-width apart
  - ⚠️ Descent: Knees tracking slightly inward
  - ✅ Depth: Below parallel achieved
  - ✅ Back: Neutral spine maintained
- **Safety Rating**: 8/10
- **Corrections**: "Focus on pushing knees outward during descent"
